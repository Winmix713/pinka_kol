## üöÄ Overview

Figma-to-Code Bridge is a powerful web application that automatically converts Figma designs into production-ready React components. It streamlines the design-to-development workflow by extracting design tokens, generating clean TypeScript/JSX code, and providing real-time code validation.

### Key Features

- **üé® Direct Figma Integration** - Connect directly to Figma files using the Figma API
- **‚ö° Real-time Code Generation** - Instant conversion from design to React components
- **üîß Advanced Code Editor** - Monaco-powered editor with syntax highlighting and validation
- **üéØ TypeScript Support** - Generate type-safe React components
- **üé™ Live Preview** - See your generated components in action
- **üîê Secure Authentication** - Multi-provider authentication (Google, GitHub, Credentials)
- **üì± Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly across all devices
- **üõ†Ô∏è Code Validation** - Built-in linting and error detection

### Benefits

- **Reduce Development Time** - Convert designs to code in minutes, not hours
- **Maintain Design Consistency** - Preserve exact design specifications
- **Improve Code Quality** - Generate clean, maintainable React components
- **Accelerate Prototyping** - Quickly iterate from design to working prototype
- **Team Collaboration** - Bridge the gap between designers and developers
